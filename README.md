# blaseball-scoreboard - now counting Salmon Runs!

The [Salmon Scoreboard](https://hora.github.io/blaseball-scoreboard/) shows completed games for a selected season that were played in Salmon weather.
It counts the number of Salmon Runs (if any) and the number of Runs Stolen (again, if any).
If the Salmon stole more runs than any of the other teams, a pink triangle congratulates them on earing a Salmon Win!
