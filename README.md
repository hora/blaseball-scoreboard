# blaseball-scoreboard - now counting Salmon Runs!

Based off of

This currently only shows completed regular season games with Salmon weather
(whether the salmon swam upstream or not).

Big thank you to [Blargo5](https://twitter.com/Blargo5) for the idea &
inspiration, and for helping design and test!
